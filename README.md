"# Tic-Tac-Toe-With-AI-JetBrains"
Implementation of the game Tic Tac Toe with AI to play against you or play against it self.
You can chose start user easy
or start user medium
or start user hard
To play against the levels ease, medium or hard.

if you chose start easy easy
it will play AI easy against AI easy
and so on for medium and hard, like medium hard etc..

I still need to make it more performatic and clean the code, I just post it like this to have a reference for my futures changes while still working.
